# Backstory

So, there’s this Japanese girl who moved to the US with her parents named Kou Ookami. 
Kou is an ordinary girl who dreams to become a mechanical engineer someday. 
She has a best friend named Millie (no confirmed surname) who has the same career as Kou. 
So basically... Kou and Millie are practicing to create robots with Kou having her robot version of herself, K0U, and Millie with a entertainment robot who can do magic, Kaori. 
Kou has no idea what to do with K0U so she would ask Millie for ideas but none of them satisfied her. 
2 years later, a robot showcasing contest has been held in the capital and so Kou and Millie joined. 
That time Kou finally decided that she’ll make K0U a robot who programs. Kou’s robot won 1st place and Millie’s robot won 3rd place. 
Millie became jealous of Kou and ended their friendship and worse, she started bullying Kou with her new bully friends. 
Kou had enough and decided to escape this cruel world and promised she’ll kill Millie for what she has done to her. 
Kou’s soul possessed K0U and no longer wanted her name to be stylized as K0U. Kou went to Millie as a robot and decapitated her. 
Millie’s soul is now possessing Kaori but the thing is, Millie did not remember anything and all she knew now is that she is Kaori. 
30 years later, Kou’s father took in the Kou robot and Kaori in his company that he established long ago and connected them into a server. 
Kou and Millie’s souls latched in the server and started created their own worlds and characters known as OCs (Omniscient Character). 
Kou’s characters will convert into her father’s cartoon characters and the worlds she created will also convert into her father’s cartoon scenes.

# Present lore

After Kou and Millie's deaths, they became software robots in a server.
Kou is the one responsible for creating worlds and even AUs of certain games while Kaori is just a mere resident.
Kou's first ever world she has created is called Arrhythmia (based off the game Project Arrhythmia).
Kaori decided to live in Arrhythmia and so Kou made 2 other OCs named Chihiro (Chiro or Chi for short) and Pyro to accompany Kaori.
Since the three are OCs, if they die, Arrhythmia itself will get destroyed.
Kaori's ability is to do magic, Chiro has fire abilities, and Pyro has weather abilities but he doesn't use it very often.
So when the Dark Hearts came in, Kaori has been brainwashed after getting infected by their virus, the Aurora Virus.
The Aurora Virus has the ability to brainwash people into being allies with the Dark Hearts and eliminate Arrhythmians.
Arrhythmia is slowly going down because of Kaori.
Kou made another OC named Alice to replace Kaori and maintain Arrhythmia's balance.
Of course, Kaori did not like that and went against both Kou and Alice.
Kaori is also the reason why Alice died.
Kou made another world called Starspace to protect those not infected residents.
After quite a lot of months, a non-omniscient character went to Kou and introduced himself as Samuel.
He said that The Heart can eliminate the Dark Hearts so Kou sent a nanobot named Hal to get The Heart while Kou tries to control Arrhythmia.
After Hal got The Heart, she inserted it into the server, curing all brainwashed residents and Kaori.
The residents that aren't infected can go back to Arrhythmia safely.
