# Backstory

Azazel is just an ordinary Polygonian living with his sister, Lucia, and his parents, Andromeda and Hoshiko.
Like Susie, he also lacks knowledge about Polygopolis because of a messed up code.
His parents are poor and cannot afford rto buy proper clothing for him so he has to wear Lucia's clothes but for some reason, he actually likes it.
His father can create clothes but Azazel refuses and told him that he should use the thread to make clothing for other people.
Azazel's mother acts pretty weird but he doesn't really care but his sister does.
Every time his other looks at him, she hallucinates about her dead twin sister and that's why Andromeda avoids eye contact with Az.
When he turned 15, Andy had enough and has to take out Azazel's left eye to stop hallucinating and so she did.
She kept the eye inside a small box and buried it by the cliff.
Azazel started to hate his mother for doing that to him for no reason (though there is a reason but she didn't tell why).
Lucia noticed that Azazel always tries to avoid interaction with his mother after taking his eye out so Lucia tried to fix that by altering his memories.
He now only has the memory that he has no left eye ever since birth and doesn't hate his mother anymore.
But at the same time when he lost his left eye, he got powers for an unknown reason.
The power to give anyone dreams or nightmares when the clock strikes 12.
