# Backstory

Susie was created by Kou and got sent to a lonely mother named Mary after losing her two children.
She has been living with her mother for 12 years.
Since Susie is just an android, her height will never change (she has been 4'11" since creation)
Susie loves music and wanted to make to compose one of her own.
She met someone at school named Kelsey and the two became friends.
Kelsey would help Susie play her songs via guitar since that's the only instrument she can play.
Susie is very extroverted and a happy-go-lucky girl but in reality, she goes on an existensial crisis.
She's being bullied for being overweight but since she's an android, she cannot get fat... only heavy.
She eats too many sweets that's why.
What Susie never knew is that her mother worships a false god called Kakovoulo Logismiko (Kalo for short).
But the thing is... Susie *was* supposed to know that but something messed up her code and started to lack knowledge about the world she lives in which is Astral Hills.
