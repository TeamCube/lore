# Backstory

Astra is the princess of Astral Hills.
She has two younger siblings, Kenzo and Saki, and a mother, Cosmi.
Their father on an adventure with an army to take The Star but neither the knights nor faer father came back.
Cosmi went insane and started to become a pessimist towards her children and all of Astral Hills.
Her personality made Astral Hills residents get mad and wishes to overthrow Cosmi.
Astra cannot let this happen so she went to the place where their father and his army left off.
Ever since Kalo went to Astral Hills, the rest of the royal family escaped Astral Hills and stays at the Central District, but except for Baroness Emeralda, she went to Polygopolis.
Astra however, is still in space trying to find faer father but Kalo is trying to stop her mission to do so.
